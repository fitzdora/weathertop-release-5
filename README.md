**Issue 1 Main issue is I never got to work out Station Analytics so I did not get the conversion to Fahranheit, Beaufort Scale, Weather Code, Wind Chill and Compass completed, not a mind even started.**

**Issue 2 - I cannot edit the existing readings. I wanted to work this area out before attempting members editing their personal email**
**Issue 3 - I jumped ahead as I was running out of time and tried to incorporate an Auto Read (Release 4) from OpenWeatherMap Api I was unable to complete this and just kept within the confines of the working model as I ran out of time to troubleshoot**

I kept strictly to collage labs as I was unable to start this project until mid August due to work and family commitments, and so ran out of time to do proper research around it.
